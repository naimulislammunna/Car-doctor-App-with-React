A digital service record is an online record of a vehicle's maintenance history.[1] A complete service history usually adds to the resale value of a vehicle. Difference between major and full service: a major service is more comprehensive than a full service; although it covers all the same checks that a full service does, a major service will be more detailed and will include more replacements of wearable parts, such as pollen filters, and changing brake fluid if required.",
